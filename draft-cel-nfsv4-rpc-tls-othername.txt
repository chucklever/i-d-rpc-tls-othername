 Remote Procedure Call Identity Squashing via x.509 Certificate Fields
                draft-cel-nfsv4-rpc-tls-othername-latest

Abstract

   This document extends RPC-with-TLS, as described in [RFC9289], so
   that a client's x.509 certificate may carry instructions to the RPC
   server to execute all RPC transactions from that client as a single
   user identity.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Background

   The Remote Procedure Call version 2 protocol (RPC, for short) has
   been a Proposed Standard for three decades (see [RFC5531] and its
   antecedents).  Several important upper layer protocols, such as the
   family of Network File System protocols (most recently described in
   [RFC8881] are based on RPC.

   In 2022, the IETF published [RFC9289], which specifies a mechanism by
   which RPC transactions can be cryptographically protected during
   transit.  This protection includes maintaining confidentiality and
   integrity, and the authentication of the communicating peers.

1.2.  Problem Statement

   Section 4.2 of [RFC9289] states that:

      RPC user authentication is not affected by the use of transport
      layer security.  When a client presents a TLS peer identity to an
      RPC server, the protocol extension described in the current
      document provides no way for the server to know whether that
      identity represents one RPC user on that client or is shared
      amongst many RPC users.  Therefore, a server implementation cannot
      utilize the remote TLS peer identity to authenticate RPC users.

   Mobile devices such as laptops are typically used by a single user
   and do not have a fixed, well known IP host address or fully
   qualified DNS name.  The lack of a well known fixed IP host address
   or fully qualified DNS name weakens the verification checks that may
   be done on the client's X.509 certificate by the server.  As such,
   this extension allows the client to be restricted to a single user
   entity on the server, limiting the scope of risk associated with
   allowing access to the server.

   When a service is running in a dedicated VM or container, it often
   runs as a single assigned user identity.  Handling this user identity
   using Kerberos is problematic, since Kerberos TGTs typically expire
   in a matter of hours and the service is typically a long running
   task.  This extension allows the client to specify the single
   assigned user identity to the server in a manner that will not expire
   for a significant period of time.

   When an RPC server replaces incoming RPC user identities with a
   single user identity, for brevity we refer to this as "identity
   squashing".

1.3.  Summary of Proposed Solution

   In the interest of enabling the independent creation of
   interoperating implementations of RPC identity squashing, this
   document proposes the use of the x.509 SubjectAltName otherName field
   to carry a RPC user identity.  For these user squashing instructions,
   this document establishes a fixed object identifier carried in the
   "type-id" part of the otherName field, and specifies the format of
   the "value" part of the otherName field when "type-id" carries the
   new object identifier.  The document also provides normative guidance
   on how the "value" is to be interpreted by RPC servers.

1.4.  Open Questions

   *  Should this be an NFS-only feature, or should it be an RPC-layer
      feature?

   *  Standardizing a fixed OID is necessary for interoperability, but
      are we required to allocate that OID from a particular arc?

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  x.509 Certificate SubjectAltName Field

   As specified in Section 4.2.1.6 of [RFC5280]:

      The subjectAltName MAY carry additional name types through the use
      of the otherName field.  The format and semantics of the name are
      indicated through the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in the type-id field.  The
      name itself is conveyed as value field in otherName.

   This document specifies new uses of the otherName field to carry an
   RPC user identity.  The receiving system (an RPC server) then
   replaces the RPC user, as carried in the RPC header credential and
   verifier fields in each RPC request within the TLS session, with the
   user identity specified in the certificate used to authenticate that
   session.

3.1.  AUTH_SYS Identities

3.1.1.  otherName OID for AUTH_SYS

      |  State the Object Identifier to be used to indicate this form of
      |  RPC user identity

3.1.2.  Format of the otherName Value

      |  This will be a set of 32-bit integers that specify a numeric
      |  UID, and a counted list of 32-bit integers that specify numeric
      |  GIDs.

3.2.  Kerberos V5 Principals

3.2.1.  otherName OID for AUTH_SYS

      |  State the Object Identifier to be used to indicate this form of
      |  RPC user identity

3.2.2.  Format of the otherName Value

   The otherName value contains a principal name as described in
   Section 4 of [RFC2743].

   What you'll need to define in your RFC:

   1.  Scope & Use Cases: When/why to use GSS principals in certificates

   2.  Security Considerations: Trust relationships, name
       canonicalization

   3.  Mechanism Requirements: What each GSS mechanism must specify for
       nameValue encoding

   4.  Name Matching: How to compare two GSSExportedName values

   5.  IANA Considerations: OID assignment request

   6.  Examples: Kerberos principals, SPKM, etc.

3.3.  NFSv4 User @ Domain String Identities

3.3.1.  otherName OID for String Identities

      |  State the Object Identifier to be used to indicate this form of
      |  RPC user identity

3.3.2.  Format of the otherName Value

      |  Follow recommendations of draft-ietf-nfsv4-
      |  internationalization-latest to form an internationalized
      |  "user@domain" string similar to NFSv4 ID map strings.

4.  Extending This Mechanism

   It is possible that in the future, RPC servers might implement other
   forms of RPC user identity, such as Windows Security Identifiers
   (SSIDs) [SSID].  This section describes how standards action can
   extend the mechanism specified in this document to accommodate new
   forms of user identity.

      |  Provide the base level of general requirements that we will
      |  have to meet in this document as instructions to future
      |  authors.  I'm not sure yet exactly what those are.

5.  Implementation Status

      |  This section is to be removed before publishing this document
      |  as an RFC.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.

   Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here
   does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has
   been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied
   by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not be
   construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.
